/**
 * Which findings the deliverable surfaces COUNT, once the Priority Board has
 * judged them: the client report, Insights and the MCP analytics tools.
 *
 * A finding drops out of their counts only when a PERSON judged it a false
 * positive, or a rule resolved it (fixed, gone, inactive). An AI review alone
 * never removes one. The reviewers, builtin and MCP, read target-controlled
 * evidence, so an injected sentence in a JS file or a response body can make
 * them answer `false_positive`; such a finding stays counted and is reported
 * on its own line instead.
 *
 * "A person" is `triage_status = 'likely_noise'` WITH `triage_source = 'human'`,
 * as `evidence.person_decided` reads it: a v3.1 node can still carry an AI's
 * `likely_noise` under `triage_source = 'ai'` until the next publish retires
 * it. A resolved state wins over everything, as in `combine_layers` and the
 * board's `_section_of`, which keeps the buckets disjoint.
 *
 * A missing or unknown `triage_state` is open: an unrecognised value is never
 * read as a judgement.
 *
 * Neither Cypher half names the `Muted` label or binds a parameter, so the MCP
 * analytics Cypher (which `scope_query` refuses for either) can carry it too.
