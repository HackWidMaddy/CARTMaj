/**
 * Scan Queue - re-confirm a needs_review job (plan Phase 5, C-4).
 *
 * A job moves to needs_review when its scan settings changed between enqueue and
 * dispatch. Re-confirming accepts the CURRENT configuration: recompute the
 * fingerprint from the live project and requeue. Object-level authz as in cancel:
 * projectId is re-resolved from the row and guardProject-ed (404 on non-ownership).
 *
 * An AI attack-surface launch also carries `roe_confirmed`: the person's
 * statement that its targets are within the Rules of Engagement. Settings that
 * changed since the job was queued (a replaced RoE among them) void that
 * statement, so the flag is cleared and the job stays held until the request
 * confirms the RoE again (`{ roeConfirmed: true }`).
