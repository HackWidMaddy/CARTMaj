    is correct there and wrong here, because CART scans internal estates on

    every private address would silently break those engagements.

    What is left is the set that is wrong for a SCANNER no matter whose estate
    it is:

    - loopback: the name points at the recon container itself, so scanning it
      means scanning ourselves. `localhost.<domain> -> 127.0.0.1` is a real and
      common record; vulnweb.com publishes one.
    - link-local: includes 169.254.169.254, i.e. cloud metadata.
    - unspecified / multicast: not a host.

    Private and CGNAT addresses are deliberately KEPT and logged by the caller,
    so an operator can see a discovered name pointing inward without the scan
    quietly deciding for them.
