"""
Where a recon run writes its JSON, and how a Domain batch merges its groups.

A single-domain or IP run keeps today's path exactly: `recon_<project_id>.json`.
A Domain batch writes one file per group and then rebuilds that canonical file as
the union of them, because everything downstream reads the canonical name and
nothing else knows about groups: the orchestrator's results and export endpoints,
the project export archive, and the GVM scanner, which refuses to start without it.

The merge runs after EVERY group, not once at the end. A batch that is stopped
half way then still leaves a canonical file that parses and describes the groups
that did finish, instead of whatever the last completed group happened to write.
