"""What a recon or partial-recon container does when it is told to stop.

Python is PID 1 in these containers (the entrypoint execs it), and Linux does
not deliver a signal from outside the PID namespace to a PID 1 that installed
no handler. Python installs one only for SIGINT, so a `docker stop` used to be
ignored until the SIGKILL: no queued graph write landed and the node-filter
sweep (the operator's mute rules) never ran.

The handler raises nothing. Raising SystemExit would unwind through the
pipeline's `with ThreadPoolExecutor` blocks, which wait for every running AND
queued task, and partial recon catches SystemExit per root and moves on to the
next one, so the grace would run out with the scan still going. Instead the
handler sets a flag and wakes a stopper thread, which:

  1. sends SIGTERM to every descendant (an attached `docker run` CLI forwards
     it to its tool container; the orchestrator removes those containers too);
  2. waits for the registered drains (the background graph writer) until a
     deadline inside the orchestrator's grace (RECON_STOP_GRACE_S);
  3. runs the node-filter sweep, once;
  4. exits 143. When PID 1 exits, the kernel kills every other process in the
     container.

While the flag is set, no new process starts (`subprocess.Popen` refuses), and
the pipeline drops new graph writes and refuses the prune. In-process Python
traffic already in flight (security checks, OSINT calls, JS downloads) is not
killed: refusing new work keeps it to what is in flight, and the deadline
bounds it.
