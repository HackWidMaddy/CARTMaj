"""The memory-governor knobs reach the recon containers the orchestrator starts.

compose forwards CART_MEM_GOVERNOR, MEM_SCALE_* and the rest to the
orchestrator only, while the ratio model that scales recon's parallelism runs
inside the recon container (graph_db/resource_governor.py, used by
recon/project_settings.py). Setting a knob in .env therefore changed nothing for
recon (drift-map #65). Both recon spawn sites now forward every knob that is set.
