"""How a worker process is started (TD-04, RV-09).

The UID, groups and process group are applied by subprocess in C between fork and exec.
A Python callback run there is unsafe once the parent has threads, and this one runs
uvicorn and asyncio, so the worker lowers its own limits itself as the first thing
worker/bootstrap.py does. Nothing of this process's environment is passed on: the
worker gets only the variables listed here, none of them a secret.
